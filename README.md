### Disaster Response Pipeline Project

When natural disasters hit communities, there is often a severe lack of organized communication between those in need and the agencies trying to assist these people. While each request for assistance from individuals and groups within these communities are typically very diverse, there are larger buckets that we can categorize these requests into to assist relief agencies in efficiently working with these communities. Thus, creating a more systematic, organizational categorization of messages to aide in this effort would be a huge benefit.

In this project, I worked on a dataset containing messages related to disaster relief efforts along with corresponding categories of each message. Using the messages and associated categories, I built a ML pipeline (and simple web app) to categorize each event/message in order to appropriately send the message to the necessary disaster relief agency.
